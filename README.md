# Local-differential-privacy
Within a course at the Sorbonne University I presented a paper on local differential privacy.<br>

The repository deals with the following research article:
["Classification under local differential privacy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04629) from Thomas Berrett and Cristina Butucea.

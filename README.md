# Local-differential-privacy
Within a course at the Sorbonne University I presented a paper on local differential privacy.<br>

The repository deals with the following research article:<br>

["Classification under local differential privacy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04629) from Thomas Berrett and Cristina Butucea.

<br>
In the beamer presentation the key results of the paper are presented, including an outline of the proof of the main theorem.

Then I implemented also the privacy mechanism and trained it on an artifical data set. In this way the following accuracy plot w.r.t the privacy parameter \alpha is obtained:
